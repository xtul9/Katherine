# Katherine Memory Orchestrator - Dependencies
# Python 3.10-3.12 recommended (3.14 has compatibility issues with ML packages)

# API Framework
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0

# Data Validation
pydantic>=2.6.0
pydantic-settings>=2.1.0

# Embeddings - using a lightweight alternative for better compatibility
# sentence-transformers has heavy dependencies (torch, onnx)
# We'll use the HuggingFace inference API or a lighter model

# Vector Store - using newer ChromaDB with relaxed deps
chromadb>=0.5.0

# HTTP Client (for OpenRouter communication)
httpx>=0.26.0

# Async support
aiofiles>=23.2.0

# Environment variables
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Logging
loguru>=0.7.0

# Embeddings - lightweight option
# Instead of sentence-transformers (which needs torch+onnx), we use:
openai>=1.0.0  # For embedding API calls (OpenRouter supports embeddings too)
tiktoken>=0.5.0  # Token counting
